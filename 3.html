  <h2>javascript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
 interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized
 as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
 Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the
 World Wide Web.[7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an ess
 ential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and
 all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. </p>
